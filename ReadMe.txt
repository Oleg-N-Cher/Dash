===========================

A goal of this project is not only produce a small funny game.
It demonstates the power of Oberon technologies, shows how a game
can be written to be launched under such different platforms.

Portability is a strong feature of Oberons, and I use it, - Dash
has portable game code (common for different platforms, written
in Oberon-1) and non-portable layers to a hardware platform.

Dash shows the portability and cross-platform in widely look,
more than mainstream solutions can propose us. Yes, I believe
that Oberon technologies are very perspective for future.
